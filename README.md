# GlassWire Service WatchDog
Small little program for making sure the the GlassWire Service stays open and clean up its dmp files that it puts on the Desktop.

This was made due to the Service continuously crashing for no reason.

Built-in .NET 8.0

It must be run as an administrator for it to be fully automated. You can make it run with administrator privileges every time by selecting "Run this program as an administrator" in its properties.
